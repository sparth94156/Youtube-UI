HTML elements - the elements that u want to add in your website.
Eg - <p>Welcome</p> (Here p is an html element)
       <button>Hello</button>

HTML tags - The whole (<>) is called html tags and the elements inside the tag is the name of the tag.

Anchor tags - Used to link to any other websites
Eg - <a href = "Link" >Link to the website</a>
href="..." this attribute is modifing how the elements behave
href is attribute name.
the link inside double quotes is attribute value.

Note -  extra spaces are ignored in the HTML.

We have a thing called CSS Selector, <style> tag makes changes to the elements written inside it.

To make changes to the corners of the buttons or any other elements we use (border-radius) , the higher the value the more rounded the borders

General Techniques - Create buttons using HTML
		Style the buttons using CSS one by one. 

border-style - used to style the borders of the elements like solid colors

spacing between elements are done using margin.

Padding is a better alternatives for height and width.

font-size,letter-spacing,margin-left,margin-right,

The trick to rounded borders is to half the height or width, whichever is lower.

HOVER,TRANSITIONS AND SHADOW - Hover is something when we shift the cursor onto any elements like buttons, it will change the style.
Transition -  When we hover over the button its changing the style and in a more smooth manner, this is done using transition.
Shadows - when we hover over any button, it will put shadows into it.

For using hover we create a pseudo class which is just an additional style to the button class
Syntax - .subscribe-button:hover{
background-color:black;
}

Note - transition take two things - what we are transitioning and the amount of time it will take.
We use . before class name to target the class.

CHROME DEVTOOLS AND CSS BOX MODELS

CSS Box models used to do spacing from the outside and the inside of the elements.
Its not a good practice to specify the width and height of the element because when i add any more text, it will overflow the element.

It tells us how much space an element takes up
how far it is away from the other elements


Important - Position property in CSS
Specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
The key feature of div is it can contains any other elements inside.
.
There are 5 different position values - static(default), relative, fixed, absolute and sticky.

An HTML entity lets us type out special characters.

class name selector has more priority than elements name selector.

Text elements is an element that is inside the line of text.
<strong> - bold 
<u> - underline 

object-fit: cover,contains ; // adjust the image to cover the entire dimension even if it's doesn't cover the whole image.
object-position: center,left or right;  // see the left, right or center side of the image



Display property in CSS - Display element

3 types of HTML block elements

block elements - takes up the entire line
inline block elements - only takes up as much space as it needed
inline elements - only appears within a line of text. Eg: strong element


<div> element - div stands for division or simply is a box or a container.
When we are making any complex website then div element is used to group all those collection of elements and show them on a web page.
block elements inside the div containers takes up only the block of line inside the container.

the div element takes 100 percent of width


Nested Layout Techniques
Types - Vertical Layout and Horizontal layout.

CSS Grid - makes more aligned horizontal layout.

fr (free space) - is a special value in a grid means to take up the remaining spaces in a grid

<div style="backgorund-color: light-blue">  -> this method is called inline style.

FlexBox is similar to CSS grid.

CSS grid is more rigid than flexbox.
flex:1 -> fr1.
flex:2 -> fr2.
Both needs container or outer container to exceute.
Here we write display: flex;
flex-direction: row;

flexbox - flexible layout

justify-content - start, end, center, space-between etc.
align-items - start, stretch, end


Note - 1. To make the shadow on inside of the element we use - inset 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);

flex-shrink:0; -> don't shrink

Searchbox have their default width and in order to remove it and cause the search box to shrink we use - width:0;

position: fixed -> to create an element thats sticks to the page while we scroll.

position:absolute -> they take the same property as fixed but with little differences.
fixed - placed in the browser window.
absolute - placed in the page.

Generally the elements that is written below are going to appear in front the elements that are written before it.
We can override the by using the another property called z-index.
So the element with higher z-index will appear in front of element having default z-index i.e., 0.
So usually we set this to something like 100 so that we can have a lot of elements in between. If our page has a lot of layers, and usually if we don't care about the Z index.

whenever a position absolute is inside a position fixed element, it's going to be placed a relative to this position fixed element.


Justify-content - center horizontally
align-items - center vertically only in case of flex-direction:row;

In case of flex-direction: column; the properties are reversed.

pointer-events:none; means when we hover over the tooltip it will not show the tooltip and will show only when we hover over the button.

white-space:nowrap;

The idea of responsive design is that the layout adjusts so that the website looks good.
Media query in CSS -  to make the page responsive.

CSS inheritance - mostly works with text properties like text-decoration, font-family, font-weight etc.
All the inner elements inherit the properties of the outer elements.
 
Semantic tags - <header>, <nav> , <main>, <section>, <aside>, <footer> etc, they are same as <div> except they give special meaning to the screen readers and give more structure to our page and screen readers.

box-sizing allows us to include the border and padding to the element.
If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height:


The <label> HTML element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.
<label for="fname">First name:</label>
<input type="text" id="fname" name="fname">

Note - margin: auto;  will work on horzontal margin only, and also won't work with floated and inline elements and by itself it also doesn't work with the absolute and fixed elements.

text-align - is used to align the text as u want.

Animation in CSS - animation-name, animation-duration, animation-fill-mode, animation-timing-function, animation-iteration-count.
animation-name : name of the animation.
animation-duration : duration of the animation.
animation-fill-mode : forward, alternate(to make the box stay at the final width of the animation).
timing-function : ease, ease-in ease-out.
iteration-count : number of times animation will run.
animation-direction: normal, column reverse, reverse etc.

to run the animation we use keyframes.

Syntax - @keyframes animation-name{
from{
	width:200px;
    }
to{
	width:400px;
  }
}

or 
@keyframes animation-name{
0%{}
25%{}
50%{}
100%{}
}

Animation shorthand Syntax - animation - animation-name animation-duration timing-function iteration-count animation-fill-mode;

The animation-fill-mode CSS property sets how a CSS animation applies styles to its target before and after its execution.
